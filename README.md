## CRUD with Express and MongoDB

*This is one of some small CRUD projects with different technologies in my attempt to learn more*

In this case the technologies I used are:

- MongoDB
- NodeJS with the next modules:
    * Express
    * Morgan
    * Mongoose
    * Nodemon as a developer dependency
    * ejs as a view engine
- Bootstrap 4

This project is a simple To-do list based on [this video by Fazt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J925fRl_UE)
